# The Problem

## Public Goods Funding Crisis

Open-source software, blockchain infrastructure, and Ethereum ecosystem tools provide massive value to everyone, but funding them remains a critical challenge.

### Why Current Models Fail

**1. One-Time Donations**
- Users donate once and forget
- No recurring support
- Unpredictable for project planning

**2. Grant Applications**
- Highly competitive
- Inconsistent approval
- Requires constant reapplication
- Time-consuming for projects

**3. Donor Fatigue**
- Requires repeated user action
- Decision fatigue sets in
- Participation declines over time
- Projects lose funding unexpectedly

**4. Retroactive Funding**
- Only rewards past work
- Doesn't fund future development
- Creates uncertainty for teams

## The Missing Piece

What's needed is a system that:
- ✅ Generates **recurring** funding automatically
- ✅ Requires **one-time** user action
- ✅ Creates **predictable** revenue for projects
- ✅ Maintains **competitive** returns for supporters
- ✅ Operates **transparently** on-chain

Traditional models ask users to sacrifice returns or make repeated altruistic choices. This doesn't scale.

## Real-World Impact

**Current State:**
- Gitcoin rounds raise ~$1M per quarter
- Requires active user participation every 3 months
- Participation drops 20-30% each round
- Projects can't plan long-term budgets

**What Projects Need:**
- Monthly recurring revenue
- Predictable funding streams
- Independence from donor decisions
- Sustainable multi-year support

Aruna solves this by making public goods funding a built-in consequence of earning yield, not a separate decision.
